The solution involves two key steps:
1. **Check Device Capabilities:** Before using features like the camera, ensure the device has the necessary hardware and permissions. This check might look like this in your React Native code:
```javascript
import * as Permissions from 'expo-permissions';
import { Camera } from 'expo-camera';

async function checkCameraPermissions() {
  const { status } = await Permissions.askAsync(Permissions.CAMERA);
  if (status !== 'granted') {
    alert('Camera permission required!');
    return false;  // Or handle the error appropriately
  }
  return true;
}

async function takePicture() {
  if(await checkCameraPermissions()){
    // ... Your camera code here ...
  }
}
```
2. **Update Expo Go:** Ensure you're using the latest version of Expo Go from the app store or Google Play Store to access the most recent features and bug fixes.  Regular updates are critical to resolve compatibility issues.
